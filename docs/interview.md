- DSA : 
- LLD : Low Level Design
- HLD : High Level Design

`HLD (High Level Design)` is the *architecture*: how the whole system is broken into services, how they communicate, how data flows, and how it scales. It answers "how do the pieces fit together?"  

`LLD (Low Level Design)` is the *implementation blueprint*: classes, interfaces, methods, relationships, and design patterns inside one component. It answers "how is this one piece built?"  
  
Think of building a housing complex. HLD is the site plan, where the towers, roads, water tanks, and power lines go. LLD is the detailed drawing of a single apartment, where each wall, socket, and pipe sits.

## HLD Building Blocks

When you design at the high level, you reason about:
- Load balancing to spread traffic across servers
- Caching (Redis, CDN) to cut latency and database load
- Databases: SQL vs NoSQL, sharding, replication, the CAP trade-offs
- Message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ) for async, decoupled communication
- Non-functional requirements: throughput, availability targets, consistency model

## LLD Building Blocks

Zoom into one service and the questions flip to code quality:

- Classes and interfaces, and the relationships between them
- SOLID principles and design patterns (Strategy, Factory, Observer, Singleton)
- Encapsulation: what is public, what is hidden
- Extensibility: can you add a feature without rewriting existing code?

## Mini-Example: Notification System

HLD view: a Notification Service behind a queue; producers publish events, workers consume and fan out to email, SMS, and push providers; a retry queue handles failures; a database stores delivery status.  

LLD view: a NotificationSender interface with EmailSender, SmsSender, PushSender implementations, a NotificationFactory to pick the right one, and an Observer pattern to update status listeners. Same system, two altitudes.
